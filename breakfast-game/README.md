# Coin Toss
A game to decide whether you'll have waffles or pancakes for breakfast.

## Instructions
Click the breakfast coin to flip it.
Click the restart button to flip the coin again.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## PSEUDOCODE
    1. Have 2 sides of a coin; waffle & pancake
    2. give an id to each side of the coin
    3. use DOM to choose a side of the coin
        - the percentage of waffle / pancake win should be 50 / 50
    4. show the result of the coin toss by displaying either waffle or pancake
    5. include a replay or start over button so user can keep tossing

## Future Ideas
- Include a table to show the history of their coin flips
- History disappears on page reload, but not on clicking "restart"

- Include a breakfast tic-tac-toe game if coin toss is not challenging enough
    - Same breakfast theme, where waffles and pancakes act as x's and o's
